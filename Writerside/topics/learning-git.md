![git-logo.png](git-logo.png)

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. Unlike centralized systems, 
Git allows each developer to have a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, independent of network 
access or a central server.

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project 
originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel
